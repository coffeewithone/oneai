<br/>

## Introduction

One AI is an open-source application designed for educational purposes. It combines Next.js and TypeScript in the frontend with GPT-4 and Llama 2 for natural language processing in the backend. This hybrid setup offers a unique, interactive learning environment for students and educators.

## How It Works

The application integrates GPT-4 and Llama 2 models for processing and responding to user queries. These AI models are accessible through an API that interacts with the Next.js frontend.

The frontend is developed using Next.js and TypeScript, offering a highly responsive and user-friendly interface. 

In production, the application is hosted on Vercel, providing a scalable and efficient platform for deployment.
